It then goes into depth about how the change improved collaboration among journalists, and reduced technical barriers. This article differs from the previous because while “The Rise of Video Chats” focuses on how virtual communication tools are shaping journalistic interviews and reporting methods, this article centers on backend newsroom operations and workflow efficiency. Instead of examining how news is gathered or presented to audiences, it highlights how stories are written, edited, and published behind the scenes.</td>
